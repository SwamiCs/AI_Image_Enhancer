Side-by-Side Comparison: Display original and enhanced images for easy comparison.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.

Error Handling: Displays user-friendly error messages for failed API calls or invalid uploads.

**Tech Stack**
-----------------------------
Frontend: React (v18.2.0)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

API Integration: Fetch API for communicating with the image enhancement service

Build Tools: Babel for JSX transformation

**Prerequisites**
--------------------------------------
Node.js (v16 or higher)

A valid API key for the image enhancement service (replace YOUR_API_KEY in the code)

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

**Installation**
---------------------------------------

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-enhancer.git

cd ai-image-enhancer


**Install Dependencies:**

Since the project uses CDN-hosted libraries (React, ReactDOM, Tailwind CSS), no local dependencies are required for the core application. However, if you plan to extend the project with a build system:

npm install


**Configure API:**

Replace the placeholder API endpoint (https://api.example.com/enhance-image) in index.html with the actual endpoint of your image enhancement service.

Update the Authorization header with your API key:

headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
}



**Run the Application:**

Serve the index.html file using a local server. You can use a simple HTTP server like live-server:

npm install -g live-server

live-server
